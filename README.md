# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was motivated by myself being overwhelmed in starting a bootcamp. I created this Prework Study Guide so that fellow students who are starting the Skills Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development to not feel so overwhelmed like myself did at the start and to show them what they can create. It allows students to have a glance on what their skills can make taking the time learning and practicing. Stops students feeling like they have been chucked into the deep end.

I learned a lot of different ways of coding to produce this guide. It allowed me to practice and get more confident as I went on ready for future projects.

This guide is a handy tool to students to see what topics we learn and notes that go alongside them to get an idea of what they will use. It also gives students a quick glance at using the DevTools console within Google Chrome to see the JavaScript running and also a glance into debugging.
